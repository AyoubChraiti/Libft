# Libft

# Libft is a pretty cool project that's all about diving into the nitty-gritty of C programming. The whole idea is to get cozy with the ins and outs of standard C library functions and then go on a bit of a coding spree. You're basically crafting your very own library, the VIP of your coding toolkit, which you can flaunt in future C school assignments.
